Create a component that uses axios to GET a random color from the random color API 
and sets that component's background color to that random color.

Use this url for your get request, making sure to use the back ticks instead 
of regular quotes to surround the string:

`http://www.colr.org/json/color/random?timestamp=${new Date().getTime()}`
