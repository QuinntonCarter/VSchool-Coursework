You just started your own airline, and you need to create a form 
to collect data about your passengers' upcoming travel plans 
so they can book their flight.

You should collect the following information from the user:

First name (text input) X
Last name (text input) X 
Age (number input) X
Gender (radio buttons with 2 or more options) X
Location they're traveling to (select box with at least 3 options. X 
-- You're an airline that doesn't fly to many places...)
Whether they have any dietary restrictions (check boxes for vegetarian, X
kosher, lactose free, etc. Include at least 3 options) X
Each element of the form should be given a name attribute so X
you can access the data in JavaScript and do stuff with it. 

There should also be a button at the end of the form to submit it. X
Upon pressing the button, an alert should appear
