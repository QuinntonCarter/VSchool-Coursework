try clear interval and set interavl for timer bonus

setInterval and setTimeout provide a way for you to 
tell your program to run a function or evaluate 
an expression after a specified amount of time 
has passed. While the first argument is setting 
what should happen, the second argument is for setting the time.

// setTimeout(arg1, arg2)

setTimeout(function(){}, 1000)

setTimeout():
delays the execution of certain code; delay the execution of the 
passed function by a specified amount of time

setInterval():
repeats code at a specific interval;
