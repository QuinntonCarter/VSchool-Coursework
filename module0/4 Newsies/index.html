        <span class="artOne">After finishing your shift at that Chinese spot you've worked at for the past 2 years, 
        you wave bye to your shithead boss who severely underpays everyone and schedules you to clopen on the busiest days to 
        maintain the favor of the person you work with who you're certain came with the building when new management took over. 
        You need to make some money, rent is overdue again and your roommate blasts the gas powered heat in your apartment, 
        despite repeat discussions and complaints, while you are stuck paying the gas bill alone and they pay electric, an agreement you'll
        always regret.
        Maybe you're coming from that upscale restaurant you finally worked your way up to. You served people all day who wouldn't know the difference
        if you brought them the wrong dish. You can't believe you went to culinary school just to serve people like this, you need to blow off steam.
        The question is, where do you go? Which place has the best guy? You know... <span class="guy">the guy.</span> He works at the local late night pizza spot and is friends with everyone. 
        He's been in that psych rock band for years. Their visuals trumphing their sound. He's the head line cook at that kick ass restaurant, conveniently right down the street
        from a prospective meet-up spot. 2 if you throw in a few free drinks. If worse comes to worst, there's always that one guy who you're
        unsure as to why he even sells. It seems at odds with everything else about him and he always wants to preach to you about one of the
        things his coke dealing is directly in conflict with, human and animal rights, being a vegan. Oh god, but there's always
        him.<span class="if"> If you have to.</span> They all have their stomping grounds but where do you usually end up? (cont. B3)</span>
